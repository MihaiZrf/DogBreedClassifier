# DogBreedClassifier

A dog breed classifier written in python using tensorflow. The model uses the MobileNetV2 architecture from keras as a base on top of some convolutional layers. The result comes from the output layer, which has 120 neurons that show the probability distribution of an image belonging to each of the 120 breeds that the model recognizes.
